# 📰 Research Paper Explainer & Blog Generator

An AI-powered project that transforms **academic research papers (PDFs)** into **blog-style explainers** for non-experts.  
The goal is to **bridge the gap** between complex research and general readers by automatically generating human-friendly explanations using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

---

## 📖 Description
This system takes research papers (from arXiv, conferences, etc.) and produces simplified summaries in the form of engaging blog posts.  
Each generated blog covers:
1. The **core problem statement**  
2. The **methodology** used  
3. The **key findings & takeaways**  

---

## 🎯 Goal
To make cutting-edge research **accessible to everyone**, by applying modern **LLM pipelines** for education and content simplification.

---

## ✨ Key Learnings
During this project, we explored:
- **Vector stores & semantic search (FAISS)**  
- **Prompt engineering** for effective LLM outputs  
- **LLM pipelines using LangChain**  
- Real-world applications of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in education & knowledge sharing  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **LangChain** – for LLM pipelines  
- **FAISS** – vector store for semantic search  
- **OpenAI / HuggingFace LLMs** – text generation  
- **PyPDF2 / pdfplumber** – PDF parsing  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a **PDF of a research paper**  
- Automatically extract and process content  
- Generate **non-expert friendly blog-style explanation**  
- Summaries highlight **problem, methodology, and findings**

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-paper-explainer.git
   cd research-paper-explainer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**  
   Add your LLM API key (e.g., OpenAI) to `.env`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

---

## 📊 Usage

1. Place your research paper PDF in the `papers/` folder.  
2. Run the explainer script:
   ```bash
   python main.py --pdf papers/example.pdf
   ```
3. The system will generate a blog-style output in the `outputs/` folder.

---

## 📄 Example Output
- **Input:** Complex research paper PDF  
- **Output:** Blog article covering  
  - Problem in simple words  
  - Methodology explained step-by-step  
  - Key findings & real-world relevance
